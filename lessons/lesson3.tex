Incipit Oratio Jeremíæ Prophétæ.\\
Recordáre, Dómine, quid accíderit nobis: intuére, et réspice oppróbrium nostrum.
Heréditas nostra versa est ad aliénos: domus nostræ ad extráneos.
Pupílli facti sumus absque patre, matres nostræ quasi víduæ. 
Aquam nostram pecúnia bíbimus: ligna nostra prétio comparávimus.
Cervícibus nostris minábamur, lassis non dabátur réquies. 
Ægýpto dédimus manum, et Assýriis, ut saturarémur pane.
Patres nostri peccavérunt, et non sunt: et nos iniquitátes eórum portávimus. 
Servi domináti sunt nostri: non fuit qui redímeret de manu eórum.
In animábus nostris afferebámus panem nobis, a fácie gládii in desérto. 
Pellis nostra quasi clíbanus exústa est a fácie tempestátum famis.
Mulíeres in Sion humiliavérunt, et vírgines in civitátibus Juda.\\
Jerúsalem, Jerúsalem, convértere ad Dóminum Deum tuum.
\\
\Rbar. Plange quasi virgo, plebs mea: ululate, pastores, in cínere et cilício:
* Quia venit dies Dómini magna, et amára valde.\\ 
\Vbar. Accingite vos, sacerdótes, et plángite, minístri altaris, aspérgite vos cínere.\\ 
\Rbar. Quia venit dies Dómini magna, et amára valde.\\ 
\Rbar. Plange quasi virgo, plebs mea: ululate, pastores, in cínere et cilício: * Quia venit dies Dómini magna, et amára valde.

Here begins the prayer of the Propher Jeremias.\\
Remember, O Lord, what is come upon us: consider and behold our reproach.\\
Our inheritance is turned to aliens: our houses to strangers.\\
We have drunk our water for money: we have bought our wood.\\
We were dragged by the necks, we were weary and no rest was given us.
\\
We have given our hand to Egypt, and to the Assyrians, that we might be satisfied with bread.\\
Our fathers have sinned, and are not: and we have borne their iniquities.\\
Servants have ruled over us: there was none to redeem us out of their hand.\\
We fetched our bread at the peril of our lives, because of the sword in the desert.\\
Our skin was burnt as an oven, by reason of the violence of the famine.\\
They oppressed the women in Sion, and the virgins in the cities of Juda.\\
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Return unto the Lord thy God.\\
\Rbar. O my people! lament, like a virgin girded with sack-cloth for the husband of her youth, howl, ye shepherds, in sack-cloth and ashes * For the day of the Lord is at hand, and it is great and very terrible.\\
\Vbar. Gird yourselves, ye Priests, and howl, ye ministers of the altar: cast up ashes upon you.\\
\Rbar. For the day of the Lord is at hand, and it is great and very terrible.\\
\Rbar. O my people! lament, like a virgin, girded with sack-cloth for the husband of her youth, howl, ye shepherds, in sack-cloth and ashes * For the day of the Lord is at hand, and it is great and very terrible.}}
